and passing comments and these unacceptable practices are usually seen as a normal part of
the urban life. There have been several studies that have been conducted in cities across India

or lack of concrete consequences in the life of women is the main reason of harassment of

women and also recognizes that women and girls also have a right same as men have to be
safe in the City.
